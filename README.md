# Normesh Home lab
This repository contains infrastructure as code (IaC), tooling,
configuration data, and other associated code needed to stand up my
home lab.

Obviously there's probably not a lot of value for you to be able to
stand up a copy of my home lab; but hopefully there is value on seeing
what choices I've made regarding IaC - either you'll learn something,
or you'll see that I've done something incredibly stupid. If so, please
let me know - the goal here is to learn!
